2017-09-04  Functional characterizations of rare UBA1 variants in X-linked Spinal Muscular Atrophy  F1000Research(F1000Prime) Our results demonstrate a surprising shift from the likelihood of these XL-SMA mutations playing a damaging role in UBA1's enzymatic activity with Ubiquitin, to other roles such as altering UBA1 mRNA splicing via the disruption of splicing factor binding sites, similar to a mechanism in traditional SMA, or disrupting binding to other important in vivo binding partners.
