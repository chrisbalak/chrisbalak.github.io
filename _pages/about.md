Chris is a Ph.D. student in the Biomedical Sciences program at UCSD School of Medicine.

Biography:
------
Chris graduated from Arizona State University with a Bachelor of Science in Genetics, Cell, and Developmental Biology. His undergraduate research at the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) under Dr. Lisa Baumbach-Reardon focused on the characterization of mutations that lead to X-linked Spinal Muscular Atrophy. After graduation, he spent time training in the lab of Dr. Matt Huentelman and the Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (C4RCD) with Vinodh Narayanan M.D. carrying out sequencing studies in families with rare neurological disorders.

Starting his graduate training at University of California San Diego, Chrisâ€™s spent research rotations focused in molecular and computational genetics/epigenetics in the context of neurological disorders. This included training in the labs of Dr. Christopher Glass in the School of Medicine, Dr. Gene Yeo at the Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, and Dr. Graham McVicker at the Salk Institute. Currently, his intersts are in gene regulation, neuroepigenetics, and how non-coding variation contributes to altered chromatin landscapes in disease.
