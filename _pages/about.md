Chris is a Ph.D. student in the Biomedical Sciences grad program at UCSD School of Medicine.

Biography:
------
Chris graduated from Arizona State University with a Bachelor of Science in Genetics, Cell, and Developmental Biology. His undergraduate research with Dr. Lisa Baumbach-Reardon at the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) focused on the UBA1 gene and X-linked Spinal Muscular Atrophy, specifically the characterization of mutations which lead to the disorder. After graduation, he spent several years working as a research associate in the lab of Matt Huentelman Ph.D. and the Center for Rare Childhood Disorders with Vinodh Narayanan M.D. carrying out broad sequencing studies in families with rare neurological disorders.

Starting his graduate training at University of California San Diego, Chrisâ€™s spent research rotations focused in molecular and computational genetics/epigenetics in the context of neurological disorders. This included training in the labs of Chris Glass M.D./Ph.D., Gene Yeo Ph.D., and Graham McVicker, Ph.D. at the Salk Institute. Currently, his intersts are in gene regulation and expression, neuroepigenetics, and how non-coding pathogenic variation contributes to altered chromatin landscapes in disease.
